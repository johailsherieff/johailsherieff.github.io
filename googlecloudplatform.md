Cloud computing is the delivery of computing services for servers, storage, databases, networking, software, analytics, artificial intelligence and moreover deployed in the Internet (“the cloud”) to offer faster innovation and flexible resources.

```javascript
Cloud SQL Instance for Database(SQL Standard):
M/C type : db-n1-standard-4
RAM(GB) : 15
Max Storage Capacity: 50 GB
Max Connections: 4000

We will require Cloud type as : My SQL and Second Generation.

Cloud Storage as a Common database as of now are using our google drive to store and retrieve the data.

Compute Engine Instance for the Capsule Network project:
M/C type : n1-standard-8
Virtual CPU: 8
Memory: 50 GB

We have implemented the Cloud SQL Database in GCP and have to import the SQL database for the database students created by the AI Skunkworks. And implementing the Cloud ML API and Data Flow API are imported into the GCP to help perform Machine Learning Algorithms.
